# Singly Linked List


## Challenge
1.Create a Linked List class
2.Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
3.Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
4.The class should contain the following methods
  a.insert
b.Arguments: value

Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
includes
Arguments: value
Returns: Boolean
Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
to string
Arguments: none
Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

## Approach & Efficiency
O(1),O(1)

## API
use insert, includes, to string
