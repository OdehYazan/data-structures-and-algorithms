# Stacks and Queues
**Stack:**
**FILO**
**and Queue FIFO**

## Challenge
**Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node**
**Create a Stack class that has a top property and creates an empty Stack when instantiated**
**This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created**
**Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack**
**Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node**
**Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the node located on the top of the stack**
**Create a Queue class that has a top property and creates an empty queue when instantiated**
**This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created**
**Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue**
**Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node**
**Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the node located in the front of the queue**

## Approach & Efficiency
**time O(1)**
**space O(1)**

## API
**Stack: pop, peek, push, isEmpty**
**Queue: enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty**
