# Breadth-first Traversal.
**A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.**


## Challenge

+ **Write a function called breadth first**<br>
+ **in order**<br>
+ **Arguments: tree.**<br>
+ **Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered**<br>
