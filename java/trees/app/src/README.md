# Trees
**A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.**


## Challenge
**do**<br>
+ **pre order**<br>
+ **in order**<br>
+ **post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.**<br>
+ **Add:Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.**<br>
+ **Contains:Returns: boolean indicating whether the value is in the tree at least once.**<br>
## Approach & Efficiency
**time O(log n) for binary search O(n) for binary tree**<br>
**space O(n)**
